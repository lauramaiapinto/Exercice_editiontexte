    <p>
    Ah! why, because the dazzling sun <br>
    Restored my earth to joy <br>
    Have you departed, every one, <br>
    And left a desert sky?
  </p>

  <p>
    All through the night, your glorious eyes <br>
    Were gazing down in mine, <br>
    And with a full heart's thankful sighs <br>
    I blessed that watch divine!
  </p>

  <p>
    I was at peace, and drank your beams <br>
    As they were life to me <br>
    And revelled in my changeful dreams <br>
    Like petrel on the sea.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thought followed thought—star followed star <br>
    Through boundless regions on, <br>
    While one sweet influence, near and far, <br>
    Thrilled through and proved us one.
  </p>

  <p>
    Why did the morning rise to break <br>
    So great, so pure a spell, <br>
    And scorch with fire the tranquil cheek <br>
    Where your cool radiance fell?
  </p>

  <p>
    Blood-red he rose, and arrow-straight, <br>
    His fierce beams struck my brow; <br>
    The soul of Nature sprang elate, <br>
    But mine sank sad and low!
  </p>

  <p>
    My lids closed down—yet through their veil <br>
    I saw him blazing still; <br>
    And bathe in gold the misty dale, <br>
    And flash upon the hill.
  </p>

  <p>
    I turned me to the pillow then <br>
    To call back Night, and see <br>
    Your worlds of solemn light, again <br>
    Throb with my heart and me!
  </p>

  <p>
    It would not do—the pillow glowed <br>
    And glowed both roof and floor, <br>
    And birds sang loudly in the wood, <br>
    And fresh winds shook the door.
  </p>

  <p>
    The curtains waved, the wakened flies <br>
    Were murmuring round my room, <br>
    Imprisoned there, till I should rise <br>
    And give them leave to roam.
  </p>

  <p>
    O Stars and Dreams and Gentle Night; <br>
    O Night and Stars return! <br>
    And hide me from the hostile light <br>
    That does not warm, but burn—
  </p>

  <p>
    That drains the blood of suffering men; <br>
    Drinks tears, instead of dew: <br>
    Let me sleep through his blinding reign, <br>
    And only wake with you!
  </p>
